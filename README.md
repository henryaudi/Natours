## üöÄ Installation

To get the Tour Tracker API up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed locally or a MongoDB Atlas account for a cloud database.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing the API endpoints.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henryaudi/TourTracker.git
   cd TourTracker
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

The Tour Tracker API requires a connection to a MongoDB database and some other environment-specific variables. Follow these steps to configure your environment:

1. **MongoDB Database Setup:**
   - If you don‚Äôt have MongoDB installed, download and install it from MongoDB's official site.
   - Alternatively, set up a cloud-based MongoDB instance using MongoDB Atlas.
   - Once your database is set up, note down the connection string, as you will need it to configure your application.
2. **Environment Variables**
   - Create a new file in the root directory of the project and save it as `config.env`.
   - Populate the `config.env` file with the following key-value pairs, replacing the placeholder text with your own data:
     ```plaintext
      NODE_ENV=development
      PORT=8000
      DATABASE=<Your_MongoDB_Connection_String>
      JWT_SECRET=<Your_JWT_Secret>
      JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d <OR another time span as you prefer>
      JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=90 <OR another time span as you prefer>
      EMAIL_USERNAME=<Your_Mailtrap_Username>
      EMAIL_PASSWORD=<Your_Mailtrap_Password>
      EMAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
      EMAIL_PORT=25
     ```
### Running the server
   1. **Start the server:** (default would be in development mode)
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   2. **Testing API Endpoints:**
   Use Postman or any other API testing tool to test the endpoints. Import the Postman collection provided in the documentation to quickly start interacting with the API.
